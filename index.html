                <h2>Great ideas happen when we come together</h2>
                <p>We worked with artists to create unique works of art that visualize collaboration and the great ideas
                    that happen when we build something together. Weâ€™re calling it The Canvas Project.</p>
                <p>And should your collaborators be halfway around the world, you can now pick one of these artworks to
                    set
                    the backdrop for your next get-together over Hangouts Meet.</p>

                <p>Influenced by the power of collaboration and connection these artists created both photographic and
                    illustrative wallpapers for the Meet experience.</p>
